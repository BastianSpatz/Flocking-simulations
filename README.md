# Basic Boid Flocking Simulation using Makie.jl

Basic flocking algorithm using Craig Reynolds' [Boids](https://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/)  in julia using [Makie.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl). 

## Overview

A quick one day build to get something going in julia, to familiarize myself with the language.

I used [Makie.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl) to make an interactive plot, in which you can adjust the alignment, seperation and cohesion values and watch them live.

After seeing the a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gS6wejsGsY)  of boids dancing i implemented a short little simulation myself.

## Installing

You need [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia) and [Makie.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl)(and the [GLMakie](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/GLMakie.jl) backend).

Clone or download and run `visualize.jl` and have fun.
